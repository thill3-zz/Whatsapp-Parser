# Whatsapp-Parser
Parser for experted Whatsapp text conversation files

This code is the programming equivalent of a lemma. It's intended to input an exported file of a WhatsApp conversation and parse it into a pandas dataframe.

If you desire then afterward the dataframe can be saved into a csv file with the code
whatsapp_data.to_csv(r'WhatsApp_Conversation_Parsed.csv', index = False)

The ultimate goal is to use this code in the creation of other more interesting analyses.
